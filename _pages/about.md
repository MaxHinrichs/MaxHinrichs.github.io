Hi, I am a PhD student in Cognitive Neuroscience at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig, Germany. I am interested in the neural mechanisms of spatial navigation, learning, and memory, and the role of neural replay.

Research Interests
======
• spatial navigation 
• cognitive maps 
• episodic memory 

Methods
======
• fMRI, MEG, (i)EEG, eye tracking 
• computational modelling and machine learning
